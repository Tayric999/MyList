# Python List Operations Example

This script demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of elements.

## Code Overview

The script performs the following operations:

1. Creates an empty list.
2. Appends elements `[10, 20, 30, 40]` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with another list `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the script as `list_operations.py`.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python list_operations.py
